I am a senior researcher at **Huawei Noah's Ark Lab**, where I focus on cutting-edge research in **Embodied AI**, **Reinforcement Learning**, and **Multimodal Large Language Models**. My work aims to advance the capabilities of intelligent systems to perceive, reason, and interact with the physical world.
